            GitHub: I am familiar with GitHub as I already had it set up last
            year when working on a game design group project, it was complicated
            at first especially when setting it up, but I eventually got the
            hang of it and now I understand it as well as how it works.

            Reflection on Readings: ‘The Library of Babel’ was quite confusing
            at first I had to read it a couple of times before I understood what
            was being said as well as conduct some research, while doing my
            research I looked at images of the library of babel and that helped
            me understand what was being spoken about in the reading. Another
            thing I saw while doing my research was a website created by
            Jonathan Basile based on this written piece by Borges and I found to
            be very interesting to see this adaptation of these multiple books
            found in these hexagonal libraries, how the website was set up and
            how when interacting with the home page you can see how it moves
            through different word combinations per letter, which we know from
            Borges reading that the books are unique and they differ by a single
            letter/punctuation, which we see in the website. Something I found
            interesting was that so much information can be found on both the
            website as well as these books in the library for cures, futuristic
            technology etc. however chances of finding the information in the
            books are very low as you would need to know what you are looking
            for and understand it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Goals for this course: My goal for this course is to develop an
            understanding of the different coding languages and know how to use
            these languages when creating websites. I am really excited to
            create websites and to know more about what makes a website
            successful and implement that into my designs.

            Experience with starting html: Starting HTML has been a very
            exciting experience for me, the lecture videos have been so
            informative as to the steps we need to take when creating a website.
            I enjoyed playing around with it by adding the various texts and
            linking various pages you would find on the web to each other such
            as the home page to the about page. It has been amazing to see what
            goes into making a website along with doing it myself.

            Reading reflections: Why Should You Use HTML5 was one of the
            readings that dealt with why one should utilise certain divisions
            such as article and section along with explaining what each of them
            are and how one can use them to make your website more user
            friendly. How A Screen Reader User Accesses the Web: A Smashing
            Video touches on how when we create websites we need to keep in mind
            the users that are unable to read, see, etc. as it will make the
            information on the web easier to navigate through and grasp. Another
            thing that stood out was when the various sites were being portrayed
            in the video one of the websites code contents was not hidden
            properly therefore the screen reader picks up those and reads it to
            the user when it is not relevant to the page the user is on.

            Reflection on Internet histories: When watching the lecture on
            internet histories as well as looking at the timeline of the
            internet, I found it quite amazing to look back at where the
            internet all started and how it has grown over time along with
            looking at the ideas put into creating these various
            websites/applications/devices.

          <h1>week three</h1>
          <p>
            Experience continuing the development of my website: When it comes
            to the process of developing my website, it has been quite slow as
            it took me a while to establish the wireframe of my website such as
            what I want to portray in my website, where I want to portray it and
            how. However, within this week I have managed to finish it and I am
            quite happy with the results of it, and I cannot wait for it to look
            like my basic wireframe. The reason I took so long when it came to
            developing my wireframe was that I wanted my website to have all
            these extravagant features but then I grew to dislike them and
            realised that I would want to create something minimal. When it
            comes to the coding part of my website, I have only done the basics
            in HTML and experimenting with some CSS but nothing much for now, I
            hope in the next few weeks to come that I can do more coding for my
            website in both HTML and CSS.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Reflection on readings and lecture: After attending the lecture and
            engaging with the reading ‘Conventions and Context – by Mailloux’.
            The lecture tied into what UI/UX is by touching on the keyword
            ‘interactivity’ and what it is, for UX can be defined as your
            interaction as the user with the product and how interacting with
            the product makes you feel. It is important to have great UI/UX for
            it plays an important role in how the end user engages with it
            ensuring that when they engage with it, it is easy for them to grasp
            the basics of the website by using appropriate conventions– linking
            to the idea of establishing a user-friendly interface/website.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thoughts on Supplementary material: I find the supplementary
            material to be quite informative and useful, for if I need something
            or if there is something I am unsure of, I can refer and take my
            time going through these lectures before seeking further help as the
            answer to the help I might need might be in the video. Watching them
            has been very insightful as I feel that I am gaining a better
            understanding of the work and it provides that extra information to
            the lectures done for the week.

          <h1>week four</h1>
          <p>
            Experience continuing the development of my website: This week I
            played around with some of the CSS coding parts of my website to
            kind of get a feel as to how I want to style it in terms of the
            colours, fonts, etc. I found myself looking at various fonts and
            font ideas on Pinterest as I want the font of my website to be very
            minimal but also very pretty. I have also examined the previous
            wireframe layout of my website and I felt that some of the designs
            were a bit too much to do as a beginner in creating a website so I
            went back to my drawing board and a made a few changes which I am
            very happy about ( I also included a variety depending on what page
            I plan in creating so that I can try out the various looks on my
            website)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            How my wireframes hold up against the readings and lectures on UI:
            When it comes to my wireframes, I feel they hold up to the readings
            along with the lectures on UI as it has been made simple and
            understandable for the user to engage with it instead of trying to
            figure out how my UI works within the game. In the reading, it
            states that having ‘great UI allows people to engage with the
            product without friction, not spending time trying to figure it out’
            (UIPin 2020) Another thing that I learnt from the reading that stood
            out is when designing the website it needs to be accessible for
            those who are visually impaired such as people with colour blindness
            or people who a blind. This stood out to me for when I watched last
            week’s YouTube video by Smashing Magazine wherein a blind screen
            reader user accesses various websites to see if they are good or
            not, there were a few in which the code that is supposed to appear
            as inviable to the user as it however when the website reader goes
            through it, it picks up some of these things that we who can see
            would not pick up for we do not normally use the screen reader. This
            is something I hope to try and incorporate in the wireframes and
            design of my website, as a website should be easy to access for all.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            How does UI relate to interactivity: When we look at what UI and
            interactivity are they are defined as follows: UI is the graphical
            representation of a program or system that allows users to interact
            with it and Interactivity is how the user can interact with the UI
            and the system that it represents and to what degree. Therefore, a
            well-designed UI should be easy and fast, allowing users a full
            understanding of the features provided along with how to interact
            with them. The level of interactivity in the UI could have a major
            influence on the user experience, influencing how engaging and
            satisfying the interaction is for the user. An example of this is
            clear and easy-to-use navigation menus, clickable buttons, sliders,
            dropdown menus etc. which can help users to engage more actively
            with the website and achieve their outcomes more efficiently.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Reflection on this week’s readings: I feel that the reading ‘The
            Basic Principles of UI Design’ is something to always refer back to
            as web designers for a good UI are crucial to having a great user
            experience and as web developers that is what we want, we do not
            want the user to be unable to use our website – as if that is the
            case our website will not be used for it has bad UI. The reading
            touched on some of the basics that we need to try to implement into
            our UI Design which I found to be very useful and allowed me to
            think about how I want to make my website a better design, not just
            for me but for the users.

          <h1>week five</h1>
          <p>
            Experience continuing the development of my website: This week, I
            managed to gather all the images needed for my website along with
            making final cuts on the images that I would like to implement into
            my website. Final cuts were also made on where certain elements
            needed to be, such as discarding my portfolio section that had a
            mini section titled runway due to not having enough information –
            being images – to put in that specific section. Thereafter I finally
            managed to implement a menu button for when you enter my various
            pages from my home page so that you can go back, there are a few
            errors such as certain works not showing and the bar hiding under
            some text and images – seen in the portfolio section of my website,
            however, I plan to fix this in the weeks to come.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Reflection on this week’s work: Within this week there were no
            readings, hence no readings to reflect upon, however, I will be
            reflecting on the technical work done within this week and how I
            found it to be. This week we looked at DOM, which means document
            object model. This refers to a programming API for documents wherein
            it defines the logical structure of documents and how the document
            can be accessed along with being manipulated.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Reflection on the exercises: When it came to the exercises we had to
            do for this week, they were the Color Chnager Exercise Setup,
            Counter and Reviews. The Color Changer exercise, I found to be quite
            difficult from the start as I tried to do the exercise in the same
            way we had done the technical exercises from the videos which
            resulted in me creating a whole new JavaScript file when I did not
            need to, instead, I needed to use the file provided and implement
            the code there. Hence why when I would engage with the webpage the
            functions did not work. In the Counter exercise, based on the work
            done in the previous exercise, I was able to see that one needs to
            make use of the JavaScript file provided which is ‘app.js’ with that
            in mind and I found this exercise to be much easier than the
            previous one. The Reviews exercise reminded me of the Quote exercise
            we did within the tutorial, this helped in terms of placing the
            quotes of the people while using the button the generate a random
            with surprised me. What I would say I found to be quite tricky about
            this exercise were the images.
          </p>

          <h1>week six</h1>
          <p>
            Experience continuing the development of my website: This week, I
            finally figured out how to make the images in my portfolio section
            clickable, it took a couple of trial-and-error runs, but I managed
            to get there in the end, and I am excited to see it work! Another
            thing I also loved to see work was my hover feature on my home page
            so that when people hover over the various page name a little grey
            line expands beneath it and the user can know which page they will
            be selecting on and that it is clickable.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Reflection on this week’s work: This week we explored JS (also known
            as Java Script) from this I learnt that we make use of arrays in JS
            to generate information/stuff that one will make use of in your
            day-to-day. JS is a scripting language that allows one to create
            dynamically updating content, animate images, etc. (MozDevNet) When
            we come to the theory section for this week, we explored the topic
            of interaction design which refers to the UI (user interface), UX
            (user experience) and IA (information architecture). From the slides
            along with the lecture video what I can say that stood out to me is
            how UI and UX connect, and how to have a great website both of those
            elements need to be developed great, as one can be great however if
            the other is not it makes the overall website horrible. The second
            thing that stood out to me was responsive design being that the way
            information is displayed on the computer should be displayed on the
            phone, however in a manner that is easy to read and access, that
            does not confuse the viewer, along with is the webpage able to be
            viewed on various devices without it looking weird.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Reflection on the reading: When we look at the reading by
            Hassenzahl, he touches on what is meant by UX (being user
            experience) and how we think it can look in the future. Within this
            reading, we can see that it emphasises the importance of user
            experience design within technology as their experience goes beyond
            mere experiences. Therefore highlighting how important it is for us
            to research so that we may better our understanding and enhancement
            user experience. Another thing that the reading touched on that
            stood out to me was how the need for research is crucial especially
            since we live in an age wherein technology is emerging, and we need
            to adapt our user experience to suit the needs of the user. To
            conclude the reading highlights the significance of user experience
            research and proposes a research agenda that considers the
            multifaceted nature of user experiences, the need for a holistic
            approach, longitudinal studies, and expanding research methods.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Reflection on the exercises: When looking at this week's exercises,
            were Side Bar and Menu. For the Side Bar exercise we needed to add
            the functionality that allows the sidebar of the website to
            hide/show itself upon clicking the burger icon and close the sidebar
            when clicking on the "X" icon. When it came to doing this exercise,
            unfortunately, the code did not work even when I tried the answers
            provided to us, it still did not want to work, however, I plan on
            bringing this query up and hopefully, I can fix any mistakes on my
            side or anything I missed so that this does not happen to me when I
            need to use JS for my main website. The next exercise was the Menu
            exercises, which was okay to understand, there were of course some
            mistakes and errors I made as I am new to the content and learning
            what needs to be done, but with the use of the memo, I was able to
            see where I went wrong and what I should’ve done instead. Overall I
            feel that I just need to practice more then I will be able to
            understand the work much better, for if I do not practice, I will
            not know what it is exactly I am supposed to do.

            My experience in developing my website: As it is the second last
            week before our website is due, I have managed to get where I needed
            to be. It has shown me that when I look back on my initial
            wireframes, how a lot of what I wanted to do needed to go as it was
            not working out and some of it did not fit my aesthetic. Along the
            way, I also encountered some problems such as some of my icons not
            showing and my menu bar not working, however in this week and the
            weeks to come I plan to try and fix all of this before the
            submission of my website.

            Reflection on Lecture by Peta Goldberg: From this lecture video what
            I can say that stood out to me was the various ethical concerns that
            come when designing a website along with the three types of UX
            ethics we find. When it comes to ethical concerns, the influence of
            user behaviour stood out the most as we as the designers of these
            websites nudge the user, and what is meant by this is that we
            instigate a system wherein we want to user to engage with the
            product in a certain way which will lead them to behave in that way.
            Linking to the idea of how we place certain interactable objects –
            i.e., buttons on the screen such as in games if you want the user to
            click a certain button you would normally place it on the right side
            instead of on the left side. And lastly, when you implement UX
            within your website there are three factors and they are ‘why’,
            ‘what’ and ‘how’. With these three factors, it is important to note
            that changing any of them impacts everything else, so one needs to
            be aware of the changes to establish a balance within the design.

            IxD Process Mashup Lecture: When looking at the IxD design process
            when I look at what I have done so far and what I have not they can
            be seen as follows, I have worked on what is known as my goal
            alignment for the website and I am still currently working on the
            other factors within my IxD document.

            Reflection on Reading: When we look at the article on ‘User
            Experience – A Research Agenda’ by Hassenzahl and Tractinsky dives
            into the concept of user experience and discusses a better method
            when trying to understand and define the user experience. One of the
            writers' main issues is the requirement for a precise definition of
            UX. They contend that, while user experience (UX) is a frequently
            used term in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) and
            design, there is still no agreement on its meaning. With this, the
            reading shows us why there is a need for us to explore the various
            dimension of user experience. Overall, the essay gives useful
            insights into the idea of user experience and recommends a study
            agenda to expand our understanding of this topic. It highlights the
            need of having a clear concept of UX, explore multiple elements of
            UX, take context into account, and use qualitative approaches in UX
            research.

          <h1>week eight</h1>
          <p>
            Reflection on Assignment 1 Website: When it comes to my website, I
            will be reflecting on it by answering the following questions below.
            What went wrong? When I look at what went wrong within my website it
            would have to be the portfolio sidebar menu, for when this menu pops
            up it appears behind the portfolio images instead of in front of the
            images, as on the other page it appears in front of any information.
            What went right? In my website, I loved how my minimal theme came to
            life, I loved that my image links worked, my hover animations and
            the fonts I imported worked. Where did I struggle? When I look at
            the areas I struggled with, some I managed to figure out along the
            way whilst others I unfortunately did not however, I know that I
            tried and that these things I can work on when it comes to the next
            assignment. Areas that I struggled with, wherein I was able to
            eventually solve were the following: <br />
            Adding links to my portfolio images <br />
            Allowing my icons on my contact page to display <br />
            Placing my images in a specific order that had the same width and
            height box shape. <br />Having my surname displayed on my homepage
            within the middle of the page. Areas I struggled with that I was
            unable to fix were the following: <br />
            Portfolio sidebar displaying behind image. <br />
            Implementing certain CSS elements. <br />
            Trying to centre the contact form submit button and the information
            displayed on it.<br />
            What would I do differently? When it comes to what I would do
            differently in my next website is trying to add a colour scheme,
            changing the way my dev blog section has been structured, try and
            create more sections within the navigation bar, a scroll to top
            button, changing the from page font and layout. These are just some
            of the stuffs I can think about changing off the top of my head.
            Overall I really enjoyed creating my website, I feel I could’ve done
            better in certain areas, but I was happy with my first result.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Reflection on the Readings: Looking at the reading for this week the
            first reading I will be discussing is the reading touching on the
            ‘study of information geographies:(im) mutable augmentations and a
            mapping of the geographies of information’ by Graham, Sabbata and
            Zook. In this reading what I would say stood out to me was the
            opening line of the reading that states “Information has always had
            geography. It is from somewhere; about somewhere; it evolves and is
            transformed somewhere; it is mediated by networks, infrastructures,
            and technologies: all of which exist in physical, material
            places.”However with that in mind the authors thus examine how
            information is not evenly distributed globally and how certain
            factors such as socioeconomic conditions, power, regulation, and
            infrastructure shape the geographies of information. Looking at the
            second reading by Ballatore, Graham and Sen touching on the topic of
            ‘ Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine Results’
            discusses how the information the user is shown/exposed to depends
            upon their geographical location. With that in mind when this
            research was conducted it also portrays how countries that are
            wealthy and well connected tend to have more locally produced
            content visible about them than countries that are poor or poorly
            connected.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            How the two readings relate and impact my thinking about web dev as
            a South African: When reading along with analysing the readings
            above, they are very insightful as it makes you more aware of the
            challenges faced by users in terms of accessing and discovering
            information online. Overall from these readings we can see how it
            brings about awareness in terms of the complexities surrounding
            information geographies, digital platforms, and the localness of
            online content.

            Continuing the Development of my website: With the technical lecture
            being a continuation of CSS it has shown me a new way of organising
            information by using flexboxes, although I know I used it in my
            code, this video showed me different ways of using it along with
            providing a much better understanding of it than I had before. I
            plan to use what I have learnt within these technical lectures into
            my third assignment and better wherever I went wrong in my first
            assignment.

            Close Reading: For the reading I looked at “Making A Feminist
            Internet In Africa: Why The Internet Needs African Feminists And
            Feminisms” by Sheena Magenya along with the theory content provided
            as I felt they both linked so well to one another. When we look at
            the reading Sheena focuses on the intersection of gender,
            technology, and culture in Africa, as well as how a feminist
            approach to the internet can promote social justice and gender
            equality. Sheena then goes on to argue that the internet can promote
            these norms mentioned before however it is still dominated by the
            patriarchal norms and structures. The author discusses how
            gender-based violence, such as online harassment and cyberstalking,
            is prevalent on the internet in Africa, and how this can chill
            women's participation and freedom of expression online, which links
            back to the idea of the internet being dominated by the patriarchal
            structure. Furthermore, the article delves into various African
            initiatives and organizations working toward a feminist internet. It
            addresses the importance of digital rights advocacy, capacity
            building, and collaboration among activists, researchers, and
            policymakers in creating a more feminist and inclusive digital
            environment.

            Continuation of the development of my website What changes have you
            had to make to your website to incorporate JavaScript: When it comes
            to the changes, I have incorporated into my website to make sure it
            displays some form of Java Script. I have focused on brainstorming
            some ideas, as I want my website to be as minimal as possible,
            finding what kind of animations/movements I want to incorporate has
            been quite tricky. I have looked at some ideas and these are what
            stood out to me and what I would want to try and incorporate into my
            website: <br />
            I’m not too sure on the correct name for this item, but basically as
            you hover your mouse over certain images it appears with a certain
            text relating to it – whether it needs to open it or close it etc.

            Reflect on Readings: The reading I have selected and gone through is
            titled ‘The Road to Technocolonialism’ by Giorgos Verdi.
            Technocolonialism refers to the influence and dominance that is
            exerted by technological powers over less developed regions. With
            this definition in mind we can see this kind of power being exerted
            by China and the United States to other countries across the world
            as their ‘success is largely due to their “domestic champions”, the
            multinational corporations that have come to be known as GAFAMI
            (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM) and BATX (Baidu,
            Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi) $3.3 trillion of market capitalization.’
            The concept of techno-colonialism is introduced in the article, in
            which centralized control and ownership of technology are utilized
            to impose dominance. AI superpowers are expected to exercise
            influence on client governments, extending their political and
            economic might while getting access to vital data. This therefore
            highlights that the rise of AI will profoundly impact geopolitics in
            the 21st century. If uncontrolled, poor countries may be forced to
            choose between adopting techno-colonialism and entering a new dark
            era.

            How your CSS relates to the HTML and JS: When it comes to the CSS in
            relation to the HTML part within my website it is clear to see that
            this coding language styles my website, to be more specific, when
            looking at my portfolio section, it places the images accordingly
            without it being on one side of my webpage. And how the CSS relates
            to my JS of my webpage is seen in the following ways. Initially I
            had placed an image on my website homepage to add some JS to my
            website, I loved the outcome of this however when I added my next
            element which was moving text, it made the website look and feel
            overwhelming hence why I decided to stick to the text as I want to
            bring across the idea of a minimal website.

            The benefits and challenges of responsive design: When we look at
            responsive design and the benefits that come with it while looking
            at my website they can be seen as having a great responsive design
            which allows the website to be accessed on any device without the
            screen on the various devices looking weird. And what I would say is
            a challenge when creating a responsive designed website is making
            sure the websites content is also responsive and changing the image
            sizes so that it does not load as long.

            Start investigating APIs: When looking at what an API is, this
            stands for Application Programming Interface which is a set of rules
            that allows various software applications to communicate along with
            interacting with each other. They operate as intermediates, allowing
            various software components to interact without needing to
            understand each other's fundamental details or implementation. They
            let developers to make requests, exchange data, and get replies from
            other applications or services in a standardized manner.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            What kind of API do you feel would add value to your website: Seeing
            that we are living in the digital age, and everything is accessed on
            the website I think it would be cool for me to add a translation API
            as it will be able to translate the text on my website, even though
            it is not much to various people across the world, as not everyone
            can understand or speak English. This would be great to draw
            attention to my website from all over the world along with being
            inclusive of those who are not native English speakers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            What are the technical challenges you foresee: I feel like not being
            able to construct the layout of how I want it to look, have accurate
            translations of these various languages google translates the
            incorrect information at times and I do not know of a lot of people
            that speak these various languages fluently that will be able to
            ensure that the spelling and construction of sentences in these
            languages are correct. Write a reflection on "Traveling While Trans"
            from Costanza-Chock, S. (2020) Design Justice: Community-Led
            Practices to Build the Worlds We Need. Cambridge, MA, USA: MIT Press
            (Information Policy) In the reading by Constanza-Chock, this reading
            can be seen to highlight multiple issues that are faced by
            marginalised groups and some ways in which we can solve these
            issues. To dive further into it, the reading underlines the
            necessity of include disadvantaged people' perspectives and demands
            in design processes. It demonstrates how cisgender norms and
            assumptions frequently affect public space design, resulting in an
            exclusionary and unfriendly atmosphere for transgender and gender
            nonconforming people. This raises fundamental considerations
            regarding designers' and society's responsibilities to actively
            confront and deconstruct these standards to build more inclusive
            places. Another important component of the article is the study of
            technology's function in both sustaining and altering current power
            structures. While technology can empower and link communities, it
            also has the potential to be used to monitor, control, and
            discriminate against underprivileged groups. This underlines the
            critical need for ethical and inclusive design methods that promote
            transgender persons' autonomy and well-being, as well as their
            safety and privacy.

            Internet, Society and Design Justice: The first reading we will be

            underrepresented people in design processes and questioning
            established power dynamics. The importance of participatory and
            community-led design processes that highlight the perspectives and
            needs of people directly touched by design decisions is emphasized.
            The talk on the politics of design and how design decisions may
            perpetuate, or challenge existing injustices struck a chord with me.
            The reader urges that us as designers critically evaluate our own
            prejudices and preconceptions to create more fair and inclusive
            design solutions. The urge to recognize and dismantle oppressive
            structures within design methods serves as a reminder of the ethical
            obligations that come with being a designer. The second reading I
            will be looking at is ‘Computer Science Communities: Who is
            Speaking, and Who is listening to the Women’ can be seen to be about
            how Women's underrepresentation in computer science has been a
            long-standing concern. The reading delves into the dynamics of
            women's engagement in computer science groups, stressing the voices
            that are present as well as the difficulties they experience in
            being heard. Women have historically been neglected and faced many
            challenges in computer science. Implicit biases, prejudices, gender
            discrimination, and a lack of representation and support networks
            are among the challenges. These variables can contribute to feelings
            of isolation, impostor syndrome, and restricted job progression
            chances. It is critical to acknowledge that diversity and inclusion
            in computer science groups are not only necessary for fairness and
            social justice, but also for the field's growth.
