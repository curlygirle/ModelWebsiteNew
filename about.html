          <p>
            I am a full-time professional model for the agency Boss Models JHB.
            I started my modelling career in the year 2022. Ever since I can
            remember, I've been fascinated by the world of fashion and
            modelling. With hard work and determination, I've been fortunate to
            turn my passion into a successful career. As a model, I have had the
            pleasure of working with renowned photographers, designers, and
            brands, and have gained valuable experience in various aspects of
            the modelling industry, including runway shows, editorial shoots,
            and commercial campaigns
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With modelling aside, I am a full time third year student at the
            University of Witwatersrand majoring in Game Design and Interactive
            Media by sharpening my skills in various aspects of the field. I'm
            constantly learning and pushing the boundaries of my craft, whether
            it's designing captivating game levels, crafting user-friendly
            interfaces, or coding responsive websites. I'm driven by the need to
            create experiences that are not just physically spectacular, but
            also meaningful and engaging. I think that design has the ability to
            alter and improve how people engage.
